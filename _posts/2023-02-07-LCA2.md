## 1. Problem
<hr>

- Input:
    a rooted tree $T$ of $n$ nodes
    two nodes $u$, $v$ in $T$

- Output:
    the least common ancestor of $u$, $v$

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Least Common Ancestor(LCA) is the well-know problem. LCA is the node furthest from the root that is an ancestor of both given nodes $u$ and $v$. The notation of LCA query of nodes $u$ and $v$ of $T$ is $LCA_T(u,v)$. In this problem, the ancestor of node $v$ includes $v$. For example, in figure 1, $LCA_T(7, 9)$ is node $4$. And, $LCA_T(2,6)$ is node $2$, because ancestor of node $2$ includes node $2$.

## 2. Sparse Table
<hr>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sparse table</i> is a well-known data structure, generally used to solve range query. Elements of a sparse table is a value of the $2^i$th information. <u>In this solution, we construct sparse tables per nodes, and the $i$th element of the sparse table of node $w$ is the $2^i$th ancestor of node $w$.</u> Precisely, there are $2^i$ edges in the simple shortest path between node $w$ and its $2^i$th ancestor. It makes the procedures of <a href = "https://unsik6.github.io/algorithms/2023/02/07/LCA1.html#h-2-naive-solution">the Naive solution</a> of LCA problem more faster.

## 3. Preprocessing
<hr>

<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80208196/217382525-f3af34f1-3445-4bb3-9e5e-539017d85653.png"><center><span style = "opacity:0.5">fig 3. Sparse Table</span></center><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Befor solving the LCA problem, we have to construct a sparse table for each node. We can construct all sparse table in an array $ST$. Elements of a sparse table is a ancestor of a node. So, $ST$ is a matrix difined as,

$$
ST[i][j] = \mathrm{the} \; j \mathrm{th \; ancestor\; of\; node\; labeld} \; i
$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;Intuitively, construction of $ST$ seems to take a long time. However, because of property of sparse table, $ST[i][j]$ is same with $ST[ST[i][j-1]][j-1]$. So, construct sparse table, while traveling nodes by in-order traversal. To determine $ST[i][j]$, we look-up the sparse tables(Memoization - Dynamic programming). Note that the first ancestor of a node is itself by the difinition of ancetor. In sparse tables, $ST[i][0]$ is the parent of node $i$.

## 4. Query
<hr>

1. If $u$ is the node whose depth is greater than another, go up until the depth is the same as the depth of the other nodes. <b>If $floor(log2(u.depth))$ is $maxD_u$, check ancestors from $ST[u][maxD_u]$ to $ST[u][0]$ until finding $ST[u][j]$ whose depth is more than the depth of $v$. If $ST[u][j]$ is greater than the depth of $v$, check ancestors of $ST[u][j]$ from $ST[ST[u][j]][j-1]$ to $ST[ST[u][j]][0]$ in same deadline. This iteration runs recursively.</b> Change $u$ to the found ancestor whose depth is same with the depth of $v$.
2. Check ancestors of $u$ and $v$ from $ST[u][maxD_u]$, $ST[v][maxD_v]$ to $ST[u][0]$, $ST[v][0]$. In the iteration, if $ST[u][j] \neq ST[v][j]$ is occur, change $u$, $v$ to $ST[ST[u][j]]$, $ST[ST[v][j]]$. After that, run the iteration recursively in a same manner to the first procedure.
3. Because the second procedure returns a child of LCA of $u$, $v$, we can get LCA from the return node.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of LCA query is same with the naive solution. However, in the solution of sparse tree, the process of finding the ancestor is performed in a similar manner to binary search, not one node by one.

<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80208196/217391595-82a93c5f-ffa4-40fa-87c7-f23a53b11730.png"><center><span style = "opacity:0.5">fig 4. The Property of Sparse Table in LCA query</span></center><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner of the first procedure and the second procedure looks like binary search. Note that we changed $ST[u][j]$ to $ST[ST[u][j]][j-1]$ in both procedure. Because $ST[ST[u][j]][j]$ is equal $ST[u][j+1]$, we don't need to check the node again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second procedure, $ST[u][j] \neq ST[v][j]$ means the ancestors of $u$, $v$ are still under LCA. If the ancestors of $u$, $v$ is same, they are over LCA because the ancestor of $u$, $v$ over LCA is common ancestors.

## 5. Complexity
<hr>

- Time Complexity:
    - preprocessing time: $O(n \log{n})$
    - query time: $O(\log{n})$
- Space Complexity: $O(n\log{n})$

&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $n$ nodes and the size of a sparse table of a node is $O(\log{n})$. So, preprocessing time complexity and space complexity is $O(n\log{n})$. And, in a query, we can find LCA in $O(\log{n})$ time. We can derive intuitively the time complexity by binary search.
