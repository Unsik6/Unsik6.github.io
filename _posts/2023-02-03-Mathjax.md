## 1. Markdown inline math
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Github Markdown supprots inline math formulas, using `$` keyword. And, using `$$`, you can post display formulas

<script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/e214da47921610670c8e6a20ec26027e.js"></script>

$x + 1 = 2$
$$x + 1 = 2$$

<br/><br/>

## 2. MD code problem and an alternative
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I write my blog, this code is not work. Differently from Github Markdown, a website launched by Github Page using Jekyll need more setting.

1. Change the value of the markdown attribute in '_config.yml' file. `kramdown`
2. Include a new file in '_includes' named '_mathjax_support.html'. And write the codes below.

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/9b7da31752fb60d250c7e50a61e75b68.js"></script>

    > Acutally, the setting above is done in the Jekyll theme I am using. I just do the stage below, and the problem is solved.

3. Include in the `<head>` of '_layouts/default.html'.

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/8c745b5b64657f273a82cf1a6907679d.js"></script>

    > the Jekyll theme I am using has 'mathjax.html' file in '_includes/extensions'. So, I change the path of the code above. I don't need `page.use_math` attribute, so erase the first line.
