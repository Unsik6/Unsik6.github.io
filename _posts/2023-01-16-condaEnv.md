&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Anaconda</i> is open source distribution that aims to simplify package management and deployment. It is often used to manage python project. You can create and use independent virtual environment.
> With conda, you can create, export, list, remove, and update environments that have different versions of Python and/or packages installed in them. Switching or moving between environments is called activating the environment. You can also share an environment file.

## 1. Enviroment Create
<hr>

1. Create an environment using the command below on Anaconda Prompt. (on the base environment)
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/c04c8769e16445375695ca0b31ba5251.js"></script>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;you can specify the version of Python using an argument below. If you do not specify the version of Python, the environment is depended on the base environment. <u>I don't know why that happens, but I recommend specifing the version of Python.</u>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/920a030ff63bdda1a3693709cbf64674.js"></script>
<br/>

2. Input `y` when you get outputs like the image below.

<br/>

3. Wait for seconds to install.
<br/>

4. It is over when you get outputs like the image below.

## 2. Check your envs
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can check your env using the command 'conda env list' or 'conda info --envs'. You can check names and local directories of envs.

<br/><br/>

## 3. Remove env
<hr>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/895cffae58df64bb51c6025ae4376550.js"></script>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can remove an env using the command above. But, sometimes the folder of an env you remove is not deleted. Just delete the folder.

## 4. Export env
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can export your env for using on another servers, devices or etc. Follow the sequence.

1. Activate the env you want to export.
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/1b1b782d14e829a90e0391801b26ef7f.js"></script>
<br/>

2. Export env as yaml file. The file will be created at the directory where your Anaconda Prompt is.
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/e7f2595f62772689e7017e5e3d43ab9d.js"></script>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Some exported dependencies will be working well in the specific environment including device, OS and etc. So, sometimes (othen between Linux and Windows), problems occur when you importing the env.</u></b>

<br/><br/>

## 5. Import env
<hr>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/unsik6/da9868d8eaf3e9cd683780cd9e1e3cdc.js"></script>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can create an env using the command above. It create a new env following meta data in yaml file including the name of env.
