&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Anaconda</i> is open source distribution that aims to simplify package management and deployment. It is often used to manage python project. You can create and use independent virtual environment.
> With conda, you can create, export, list, remove, and update environments that have different versions of Python and/or packages installed in them. Switching or moving between environments is called activating the environment. You can also share an environment file.

## 1. Enviroment Create
<hr>

1. Create an environment using the command below on Anaconda Prompt. (on the base environment)
    ```bash
    conda create --name {env name}
    ```
    
    you can specify the version of Python using an argument below. If you do not specify the version of Python, the environment is depended on the base environment. <u>I don't know why that happens, but I recommend specifing the version of Python.</u>
    ```bash
    conda create --name {env name} python={version}
    ```
<br/>

2. Input 'y' when you get outputs like the image below.

<br/>

3. Wait for seconds to install.
<br/>

4. It is over when you get outputs like the image below.

## 2. Check your envs
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can check your env using the command 'conda env list' or 'conda info --envs'. You can check names and local directories of envs.
```bash
conda env list
conda info --envs
```
<br/><br/>

## 3. Remove env
<hr>

```bash
conda remove --name {env name} --all
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can remove an env using the command above. But, sometimes the folder of an env you remove is not deleted. Just delete the folder.

## 4. Export env
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can export your env for using on another servers, devices or etc. Follow the sequence.

1. Activate the env you want to export.
    ```bash
    conda activate {env name}
    ```
<br/>

2. Export env as yaml file. The file will be created at the directory where your Anaconda Prompt is.
    ```bash
    conda env export > {file name}.yaml
    ```

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Some exported dependencies will be working well in the specific environment including device, OS and etc. So, sometimes (othen between Linux and Windows), problems occur when you importing the env.</u></b>

<br/><br/>

## 5. Import env
<hr>

```bash
conda env create -f {file name}.yaml
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can create an env using the command above. It create a new env following meta data in yaml file including the name of env.
