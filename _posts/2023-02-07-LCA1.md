## 1. Problem
<hr>

- Input:
    a rooted tree $T$ of $n$ nodes
    two nodes $u$, $v$ in $T$

- Output:
    the least common ancestor of $u$, $v$

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Least Common Ancestor(LCA) is the well-know problem. LCA is the node furthest from the root that is an ancestor of both given nodes $u$ and $v$. The notation of LCA query of nodes $u$ and $v$ of $T$ is $LCA_T(u,v)$. In this problem, the ancestor of node $v$ includes $v$. For example, in figure 1, $LCA_T(7, 9)$ is node $4$. And, $LCA_T(2,6)$ is node $2$, because ancestor of node $2$ includes node $2$.

## 2. Naive solution
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this post, I introduce naive solution of LCA problem. It is very simple and intuitive.

<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80208196/217371462-0406f0b8-9a66-4ddd-a023-b92d23677241.png"><center><span style = "opacity:0.5">fig 2. The outline of naive solution</span></center><br/>

1. If $u$ is the node whose depth is greater than another, go up by checking one node at a time toward the root until the depth is the same as the depth of the other nodes. Change $u$ to the found ancestor whose depth is same with the depth of $v$.
2. Go up one node at a time from node $u$ and $v$ toward the root. And, check whether the currently checked ancestor nodes of $u$ and $v$ are same.

&nbsp;&nbsp;We can find LCA of &u& and &v& in both the first procedure and the second procedure.

## 3. Complexity
<hr>

- Time Complexity:
    - query time: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$

&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more space used. In the worst case, if $T$ is a skewed tree, both procedures runs in $O(N)$ time.
