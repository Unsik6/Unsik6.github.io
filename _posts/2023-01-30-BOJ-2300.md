## 1. Problem
<hr/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BOJ_2300 is the problem of dynamic programming. The level of problem is <span style="color:gold">Gold 3</span>.<a href="https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2300">(Link of the problem of BOJ)</a><br/>

<b><i>Inputs</i></b>
- The number of buildings: <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>N (1&#8804;N&#8804;10,000)</i></font>
- The position of <i>i</i>th building for each row: <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>x, y (&#124;x&#124;, &#124;y&#124; &#8804; 1,000,000)</i></font>

<b><i>Conditions</i></b>
- The <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>y</i></font>-coordinate of all buildings are not 0.
- The line of communication equals x-axis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;In the figure above, the answer is 9. There are 7 buildings, <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>(-4, -1), (-2, -1), (0, 2), (1, -1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (8, -1)</i></font>. And, by the answer, there are 3 base stations, <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>(-2, 0), (2, 0), (6.5, 0)</i></font>.

## 2. Approach to the problem
<hr/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is an usual problem of dynamic programming with partition. It is similar with the well-known problem called <i>Matrix-Chain Multiplication</i> problem. The main problem is finding ranges of communications with minimal sum of construction cost. It can be divied some subproblems, if the problem is divided the group of buildings whose x-coordinate is consecutive. In the fig 1, the main problem consists of 7 buildings. We can find directly 3 subproblems-each of them have one range of communication. And intuitively main problem and subproblems have same structures. Because subproblems defined with buildings whose x-coordinate is consecutive are independent of each other and the solution is the minimal value, moreover, the optimal solution is sum of optimal subsoltion. <b><u>That is, there is an optimal substructure.</u></b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividing the main problem into 3 subproblems makes solution complicated. So, let's divide the main problem into 2 subproblem. Because we have to consider all possible case, we solve all case and compare them. So, the soltion can be expressed as recursion, if the solution about buildings from <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>i</i></font>th to <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>j</i></font>th after sorting by <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>x</i></font>-coordinate is defined as <i>`T(i, j)`</i>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>There are overlapping problems.</u></b> For example, by the definition above, we have to solve <i>`T(1, 3)`</i> and <i>`T(1, 4)`</i> to solve <i>`T(1, 6)`</i>. <i>`T(1, 3)`</i> and <i>`T(1, 4)`</i> include <i>`T(1, 2)`</i>.<br/>

<br/><br/>

## 3. Solve the problem: How to apply DP
<hr/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before solve the problem using the definition above, we have to tranform the recursion. The recursion does not include grouping <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>N</i></font> buildings in one range of communication. Futhermore, although the problem size of <i>`T(1, 3)`</i> and <i>`T(4, 6)`</i> are same, the buildings of each problem are not same. So, we have to solve a lot of problems. Think about the definition. The each case of <i>`T(1, N)`</i> includes <i>`T(1, 1), T(1, 2), ... , T(1, N-1)`</i>. They have overlapping problems with same buildings. And, we just try grouping the rest of buildings into one range of communication, bucause the solution is the minimal value. If the group makes more cost, just drop the case and choose the other case. It is correct because the groups of buildings are perfectly independent. For exmaple, the optimal solution of <i>`T(1, 4)`</i> consists of groups <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>(1..2), (3..4)</i></font>. Then, we already solve <i>`T(1, 1), T(1, 2), T(1, 3)`</i>. Think about <i>`T(1, 5)`</i>. If the optimal solution of <i>`T(1, 5)`</i> includes <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>(5)</i></font>, the optimal solution consist of groups <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>(1..2), (3..4), (5)</i></font>. It means <i>`T(1, 5)`</i> is solved by <i>`T(1, 4)`</i> and one range including the 5th building. Otherwise, if the optimal solution of <i>`T(1, 5)`</i> includes <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>(4..5)</i></font>, we can't use the optimal solution of <i>`T(1, 4)`</i>. Because the solution of <i>`T(1,4)`</i> includes the group <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>(3..4)</i></font> that conflicts with the group (4..5). But we can use <i>`T(1, 3)`</i> that is already solved. So, <i>`T(1, 5)`</i> is solve by <i>`T(1, 3)`</i> and one range including the 4th building and the 5th building. So, we can change the definition as below.

<center><img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80208196/215582967-b43d2fe1-40d9-4cb7-9896-8691009addc7.png"></center><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;We start <i>k</i> from 0 to include a group including whole buildings. <i>`T(0,0)`</i> is the base case. The optimal solution of the base case is 0.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Solving <i>`Cost_by_a_group(k,N)`</i> is easy. The maximal height (absolute value of the y-coordinate of buildings) in the problem makes the biggest range of communication, and this range must exist. So, if the biggest range can include all buildings in the range, we don't need to consider other ranges. Else, the optimal range of communication must include the leftmost building at its left side and the rightmost building at its right side. Because we consider the biggest range made by the building whose height is maximal height among the buildings in the problem first, it is guarnteed the optimal range is bigger than the biggest range made by the building.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the definition of problem is fixed.

<center><img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80208196/215585782-6f17b806-0571-48b3-9e50-736f4c83064c.png"></center><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;By the definition, constructing the algorithm is easy, using double nested iteration. The outer iteration with iterator <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>i</i></font> defines the size of a problem, <i>`T(1, i)`</i>. The inner iteration with iterator <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>j</i></font> is the size of buildings grouped by one range of communication, <i>`Cost_by_a_group(j,N)`</i>. The iterator <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>j</i></font> decrease by one from <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>i</i></font>, updating the maximal height among the buildings.

<br/><br/>

## 4. Time Complexity
<hr/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a double nested iteration. And, <i>`Cost_by_a_group(j,N)`</i> is solve in <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>O(1)</i></font> time using an array to store buildings. So, total time complexity is <font face = "Cambria Math"><i>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</i></font>.

<br/><br/>

		dp[i] = INF;
		int maxHeight = 0;
		for (int j = i; j >= 1; j--)

			// Grouping from the jth building to ith building in a range of communication.
			
			// Update maximal height.
			maxHeight = max(maxHeight, abs(buildings[j].second));

			// Comapre the case with the optimal value computed last.
			dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + max(2 * maxHeight, buildings[i].first - buildings[j].first));
		}
	}
	
	// Output
	cout << dp[N];

	return 0;
}
